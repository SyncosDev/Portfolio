            This website is a a Japanese learning program I built along my journey and will continue updating as my learning continues. The course will start with learning the alphabets such as Hiragana and Katakana.
            Then move on to grammar rules and giving tips and tricks to immerse yourself in the language. Some of the tips may require money but there is still always gonna be a slightly worse free example. To begin the 
            course start by click "The course" in the top menu but progress won't save at the current version, updating this feature ones I learn to implement it myself.
