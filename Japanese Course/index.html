        <h2>#1 Course Lesson</h2>
        <p>
          The first step to mastering the japanese language is learning the
          alphabets. Don't worry! We'll only start with Hiragana and then
          introduce Katakana and Kanji later on. This lesson will span roughly a
          month to make sure the characters stay before moving on. There will be
          information about each row of characters and then pratice exercises
          related to the information you learn't. This will basically work like
          school but instead of focusing on presenting a powerpoint
          presentation. Hikari Nihongo focuses on making the user to put the
          knowledge to use as fast as possible because it stays better when you
          do it and understand it. So let's get started with the first lesson.

        <h2> Hiragana </h2>
        <p>
          Hiragana is thbe alphabet in Japanese used for native words connected to Japan.
          The alphabet is often divided into 10 different rows of characters with 3 addiontal
          characters that work a bit differently compared to any of the other rows. The exercises below will
          be about the first row, also called the vowels of the alphabet. They consist of the
          sounds of A, I, U, E, O.

        <h2> The First Row </h2>
        <p>
          The first row consisting of A, I, U, E, O have a special use as they can be used to create longer vowels.
          At the start you'll only learn about the base of the characters and later on expanding on their usage. Each 
          character has a so called stroke order. I means to draw them correctly each line has to be drawn in order. Therefore
          you'll learn the correct way from the start. To begin learning the characters like on the first exercise.
