        <h2>#1 Course Lesson</h2>
        <p>
          Japanese might appear as a difficult langauge. Don't get me wrong it is. But
          giving up is not necessary as learning any language will be challenging at the
          start. Don't letter the multiple alphabets and unknown characters scare you off
          because I believe anyone can learn it, if they put their mind to it.
        </p>
        <p> 
          To improve as much as possible while using this course you'll have to constantly 
          imerse yourself. Learning words and characters and words without using them often
          is useless. Therefore reading books and watching movies is a great way to both pick
          up the language and refresh the vocabulary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step to mastering the japanese language is learning the
          alphabets. Don't worry! We'll only start with Hiragana and then
          introduce Katakana and Kanji later on. This lesson will span roughly a
          month to make sure the characters stay before moving on. There will be
          information about each row of characters and then pratice exercises
          related to the information you learn't. This will basically work like
          school but instead of focusing on presenting a powerpoint
          presentation. Hikari Nihongo focuses on making the user to put the
          knowledge to use as fast as possible because it stays better when you
          do it and understand it. So let's get started with the first lesson addiontal
          goodluck on your journey to fluency. I'll provide as much help as I can to make
          sure you succeed.

        <h2> Hiragana </h2>
        <p>
          Hiragana is thbe alphabet in Japanese used for native words connected to Japan.
          The alphabet is often divided into 10 different rows of characters with 3 addiontal
          characters that work a bit differently compared to any of the other rows. The exercises below will
          be about the first row, also called the vowels of the alphabet. They consist of the
          sounds of a, i, u, e, o.
        </p>

        <h2> The First Row </h2>
        <p>
          The first row of the hiragana alphabet consist of the vowel sounds. They're prounuced like the letters
          a, i, u, e and o. Each one of them have their own stroke order that technically doesn't mean anything other
          then the fact someone thought it was the best way to draw them back in the day. Because of this we'll learn
          writing them correctly already from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vowels doesn't only serve the purpose of being letters. They can also create something called longer vowels.
          This means that adding a vowel in front of another hiragana characters creates a long sound instead of the regular.
          This might appear as a small feature but is the only way to hear the differece between certain words. Saying the wrong
          word might leave you in a bit of trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture below shows the characters but not the stroke order. Learning the stroke is something you will do unconsiousnly 
          while just trying to draw them in the exercises. So don't worry about that. In the picture there is also a few words that might
          be usefull later on in your journey but take it as homework to memorize these at the same time as learning the characters. The words
          only require the vowels to be spelled and therefore is a perfect match. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you know the basics of what's coming it's time to start doing some exercises. The first part will consist of writing the letter
          that match the shown character in the small box. The second phase will be the flipped where you will not write but draw the character using
          your mouse. This will guide you to do it in the correct stroke order so just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. Goodluck with your
          first exercise.
